    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butterbeer, from the Harry Potter book series, is described as foamy, spicy, and creamy. 
        The culinary team at Universal Orlando spent two years researching and developing the 
        (closely guarded) recipe.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butterscotch topping</li>
            <li>1 to 2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>6 (12 ounce) bottles cream soda</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Freeze 6 mugs or pint glasses until icy, at least 15 minutes. Meanwhile, 
                for whipped topping, beat together cream, cinnamon, and salt in a medium 
                bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until stiff peaks form. Add 
                butterscotch topping and lemon juice; beat again until soft peaks form. </li>
            <li>For each butterbeer, pour 1 can cream soda into a mug; top with about 2 tablespoons 
                whipped topping. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Test Kitchen Tip</h3>
        <p>Start with 1 teaspoon lemon juice in the whipped topping; add up to 1 teaspoon more for a less sweet sipper. For a boozy version, sub out butterscotch topping for 1 ounce butterscotch schnapps and add 1 1/2 ounces gold or spiced rum to each glass with the cream soda.</p>
